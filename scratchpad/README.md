# Scratchpad

## Overview
A workspace for temporary files, notes, experiments, and work-in-progress documentation. This directory serves as a staging area for ideas and configurations before they're finalized.

## Purpose
- **Experiments** - Test configurations before committing
- **Notes** - Quick documentation and reminders
- **Drafts** - Work-in-progress files
- **Templates** - Reusable configuration snippets
- **Temporary** - Files that don't belong elsewhere yet

## Current Contents
- `recommendations.md` - Configuration recommendations and optimization notes

## Organization Guidelines
- Use descriptive filenames with dates when relevant
- Clean up regularly - move finalized content to proper locations
- Document experiments with comments
- Keep backups of working configs before major changes

## Usage Tips
- Use this space to test new tool configurations
- Store command snippets and one-liners
- Keep notes about debugging sessions
- Save interesting code examples

## File Naming Convention
Suggested format for clarity:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-description.ext` for dated content
- `tool-name-test.conf` for config experiments  
- `TODO-feature.md` for pending tasks
- `backup-original-name.ext` for backups

## Maintenance
- Review monthly and archive/delete old files
- Move successful experiments to proper config directories
- Convert useful notes into proper documentation
